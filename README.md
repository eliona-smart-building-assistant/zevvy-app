# App Template

This template is a part of the Eliona App SDK. It can be used to create an app stub for an Eliona environment.

## Configuration

The app needs environment variables and database tables for configuration. To edit the database tables the app provides an own API access.


### Registration in Eliona ###

To start and initialize an app in an Eliona environment, the app has to be registered in Eliona. For this, entries in database tables `public.eliona_app` and `public.eliona_store` are necessary.

This initialization can be handled by the `reset.sql` script.


### Environment variables

<mark>Todo: Describe further environment variables tables the app needs for configuration</mark>

- `CONNECTION_STRING`: configures the [Eliona database](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/go-eliona/tree/main/db). Otherwise, the app can't be initialized and started (e.g. `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/iot`).

- `INIT_CONNECTION_STRING`: configures the [Eliona database](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/go-eliona/tree/main/db) for app initialization like creating schema and tables (e.g. `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/iot`). Default is content of `CONNECTION_STRING`.

- `API_ENDPOINT`:  configures the endpoint to access the [Eliona API v2](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/eliona-api). Otherwise, the app can't be initialized and started. (e.g. `http://api-v2:3000/v2`)

- `API_TOKEN`: defines the secret to authenticate the app and access the Eliona API.

- `API_SERVER_PORT`(optional): define the port the API server listens. The default value is Port `3000`. <mark>Todo: Decide if the app needs its own API. If so, an API server have to implemented and the port have to be configurable.</mark>

- `LOG_LEVEL`(optional): defines the minimum level that should be [logged](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/go-utils/blob/main/log/README.md). The default level is `info`.

### Database tables ###

<mark>Todo: Describe other tables if the app needs them.</mark>

The app requires configuration data that remains in the database. To do this, the app creates its own database schema `template` during initialization. To modify and handle the configuration data the app provides an API access. Have a look at the [API specification](https://eliona-smart-building-assistant.github.io/open-api-docs/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/app-template/develop/openapi.yaml) how the configuration tables should be used.

- `template.configuration`: Contains configuration of the app. Editable through the API.

- `template.asset`: Provides asset mapping. Maps broker's asset IDs to Eliona asset IDs.

**Generation**: to generate access method to database see Generation section below.

### App API ###

The app provides its own API to access configuration data and other functions. The full description of the API is defined in the `openapi.yaml` OpenAPI definition file.

- [API Reference](https://eliona-smart-building-assistant.github.io/open-api-docs/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/app-template/develop/openapi.yaml) shows details of the API

**Generation**: to generate api server stub see Generation section below.


### Eliona assets ###

This app creates Eliona asset types and attribute sets during initialization.

The data is written for each device, structured into different subtypes of Elinoa assets. The following subtypes are defined:

- `Info`: Static data which provides information about a device like address and firmware info.
- `Status`: Device status information, like battery level.
- `Input`: Current values reported by sensors.
- `Output`: Values that are to be passed back to the provider.

### Continuous asset creation ###

Assets for all devices connected to the Template account are created automatically when the configuration is added.

To select which assets to create, a filter could be specified in config. The schema of the filter is defined in the `openapi.yaml` file.

Possible filter parameters are defined in the structs in `broker.go` and marked with `eliona:"attribute_name,filterable"` field tag.

To avoid conflicts, the Global Asset Identifier is a manufacturer's ID prefixed with asset type name as a namespace.

### Dashboard ###

An example dashboard meant for a quick start or showcasing the apps abilities can be obtained by accessing the dashboard endpoint defined in the `openapi.yaml` file.

## Tools

### Generate API server stub ###

For the API server the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/openapi-yaml) for go-server is used to generate a server stub. The easiest way to generate the server files is to use one of the predefined generation script which use the OpenAPI Generator Docker image.

```
.\generate-api-server.cmd # Windows
./generate-api-server.sh # Linux
```

### Generate Database access ###

For the database access [SQLBoiler](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler) is used. The easiest way to generate the database files is to use one of the predefined generation script which use the SQLBoiler implementation.

```
.\generate-db.cmd # Windows
./generate-db.sh # Linux
```

### Generate asset type descriptions ###

For generating asset type descriptions from field-tag-annotated structs, [asse-from-struct tool](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/dev-utilities) can be used.
